Aloha there! I am a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate at College of Computer Science of Nankai University, advised by Prof. Tao Li and Ye Lu. I am affliated with [Nankai Intelligent Computing System Lab](https://ics.nankai.edu.cn/) and [Haihe Lab of ITAI](https://www.hl-it.cn/). 

I will be a visiting scholar at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) supervised by [Prof. Weichen Liu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/liu/) with the sponsorship of China Scholarship Council (CSC) for 12 months, from March 2025 to March 2026. 

My research interest includes intelligent computing system, system security, and trusted execution environment. I have published 14 papers at the top international journals and conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LCsCUrMAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>90+</span></strong></a> <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LCsCUrMAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
